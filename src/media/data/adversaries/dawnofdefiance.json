Slender and with slightly spiky graying hair, Captain Vischera has a brilliant mind tainted by a sadistic streak that makes him perfect for Imperial service. Vischera has hollow cheeks and sunken eyes, giving the impression that he is malnourished and doesn’t get enough sleep, and his Imperial uniform (though conforming to all standards) looks as though it is hanging off his body. Vischera wants nothing more than to continue his experiments, and as such he will defend the facility to his death.\n\nWhen the encounter begins, Captain Vischera immediately commands Kargrek and Hagark to defend him, then orders the stormtroopers to take down the intruders. If either Kargrek or Hagark drops below half its hit points, Vischera uses his Inspiring Rhetoric (Supreme) talent to get the injured bodyguard back in the fight. Whenever possible, Vischera uses his blaster pistol.",
