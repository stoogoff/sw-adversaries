The Corpo­rate Sector Authority Viceprex level officials head up en­tire departments of the CSA, from research to legal to territorial management. A Viceprex is a powerful individ­ual whose rank and influence lets him ignore petty con­cerns such as laws and regulations. The CSA does not overly care about the actions of their officials as long as the profits flow, so while one Viceprex might be honor­able and honest, another may be corrupt and malicious.",

Cyborg administrators often seem less human, distracted as they are by a constant stream of information from outside. As a result, they are not typically well-liked by most despite their enhanced abilities.

A spaceport ad­ministrator can be an incredible ally for a pilot and his crew or he can make their lives so miserable that they avoid certain spaceports at all cost.",

		"description": "In the grand scheme of galactic travel and trade, an individual spaceport is rarely something of consequence. Indeed, many traders and travelers see dozens or hundreds of them over the course of a single year, perhaps even a single month. Each individual spaceport has its own administrator, a single being whose sole purpose is to ensure the safe and efficient operation of that particular port of call. These men and women frequently operate under a shared common code of regulations determined by the Empire, but they might also have individual sector, system, planetary, or even personal regulations that they are inclined to observe. This makes each visit at a particular spaceport a unique experience. Regardless of their quirks, most are bureaucrats and cogs in the Imperial machine, but some still have the wherewithal to place their covert support behind the Rebel Alliance.",

Likewise, they can either be de­spised by the spaceport staff or be looked upon as little brother and sisters s to be watched over.

Younger nobles sometimes have a taste for excitement and adventure, however, and occasionally venture out to see the galaxy and experience how the lesser beings live. Most of these young nobles are capricious and largely without compassion, but a handful occasionally find the plight of the galaxy deplorable enough to find a way to discreetly offer their assistance to the Alliance. Such patrons are rare, but extremely valuable to the Rebels, who court them as much as they can without compromising their political and military agendas.",
