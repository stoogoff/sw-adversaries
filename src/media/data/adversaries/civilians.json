		"description": "In the grand scheme of galactic travel and trade, an individual spaceport is rarely something of consequence. Indeed, many traders and travelers see dozens or hundreds of them over the course of a single year, perhaps even a single month. Each individual spaceport has its own administrator, a single being whose sole purpose is to ensure the safe and efficient operation of that particular port of call. These men and women frequently operate under a shared common code of regulations determined by the Empire, but they might also have individual sector, system, planetary, or even personal regulations that they are inclined to observe. This makes each visit at a particular spaceport a unique experience. Regardless of their quirks, most are bureaucrats and cogs in the Imperial machine, but some still have the wherewithal to place their covert support behind the Rebel Alliance.",

Younger nobles sometimes have a taste for excitement and adventure, however, and occasionally venture out to see the galaxy and experience how the lesser beings live. Most of these young nobles are capricious and largely without compassion, but a handful occasionally find the plight of the galaxy deplorable enough to find a way to discreetly offer their assistance to the Alliance. Such patrons are rare, but extremely valuable to the Rebels, who court them as much as they can without compromising their political and military agendas.",
