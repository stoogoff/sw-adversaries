Semi-intelligent, gundarks grasp the basic use of tools, but they lack any known language or other hallmark of a sentient species. Their sheer ferocity has made them a popular target for big game hunters and those who enjoy pitting creatures against one another in gladiatorial-style contests. In this way, the beast has spread to different worlds throughout the galaxy, where it flourishes in certain environments and planets. In many cases, the beasts are hunted to extinction because of the threat they pose to natural wildlife and the denizens of a given planet, but on worlds with larger regions of untamed wilderness, packs of gundarks can survive and thrive in areas without ever encountering sentient life.",

Brightly colored avians with reptilian features, jubba birds are prized for their red, yellow, and purple plumage as much as for their beautiful, haunting song. The jubba bird’s whis­ tling call is actually an instinctual ability to tap into the Living Force, and it produces a peaceful sensation in those who hear it. Jubba birds have small bodies but large wings, and they fare poorly in cages. Luckily, if an owner feeds his bird regularly, it is more than content to remain on a roost or perch and refrain from terror­ izing a household or attempting to hunt other pets. On Dagobah, jubba birds hunt small prey such as rodents or other birds, but in captivity, a well-fed jubba bird will fight only to defend itself. Most importantly, if the jubba bird is not content, it refuses to sing.\n\nFew owners realize that jubba birds are deceptively intelligent. While not as smart as most sapient spe­cies, they possess a level of cunning and a capacity for comprehension that dwarfs most animal species. Some researchers suspect that jubba birds deliberate­ ly pretend to be less intelligent when interacting with other species. These suspicions are only reinforced by rumors that, when paired with owners they trust and care for, jubba birds can act with more deliberation and foresight.",

While considerably larger than the average equinoid, lava fleas have an uncharacteristically lightweight frame. This makes them ideal for leaping considerable distances, but less adapted for hauling heavy loads. The creature’s exoskeleton evolved an internal structure of spindles not unlike an internal bone structure, made from the minerals the lava flea digests. This allows these extraordinary beasts to grow to sizes far beyond normal evolutionary constraints. Mustafarians often fashion discarded lava flea shells into heat-resistant armour.",

Despite whaladons’ sentience, offworlders have been known to hunt them for sport and profit.",

A vornskr immediately focuses on any Force-sensitive creatures or individuals in its pres­ence as soon as it senses them, and generally attacks without hesitation.

These docile, tree-dwelling creatures resemble half-meter-long furred lizards and live deep within the forests of Myrkr, where they have claimed the canopy as their own. They are herbivores, feasting on the sap of the trees in which they live, and they use only their teeth to defend themselves if attacked.

Although naturally stealthy and elusive, nexu do not lack for ferocity or mettle in a direct fight, and they rarely back down in the face of any threat they encounter. Even when faced with a more ferocious predator, nexu are more likely to attempt to melt away into the underbrush and attack again using stealth to gain an advantage than to simply flee their hunting grounds.",
