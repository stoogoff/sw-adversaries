These fictional accounts would have one believe that innumerable Jedi survived the purge conducted by the Empire, but in truth fewer than one hundred of the thousands of Jedi survived. The majority of those who did were hunted and killed shortly thereafter by Darth Vader and the Imperial forces under his command. The Alliance would desperately like to believe that there are Jedi in hiding who escaped the purge and might join the Rebels in their struggle.
