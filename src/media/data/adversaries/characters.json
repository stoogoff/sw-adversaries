Pilots like him because, instead of berating them after damaging their vessels and his work, he takes great pride in their survival and keeping their ships in space, often through highly creative methods. They soon discover that some of his unusual repairs sacrifice comfort and convenience to get the job done, and the results can go undetected by the pilots until inopportune moments during the next mission or flight. While not fatal, the repairs sometimes force the pilots to hastily alter their flying style, weapons, or defenses. Experienced pilots soon learn to take test flights after repairs or alterations, and more than a few can be heard cursing Jolt across the comm system when they discover a troublesome issue.\n\nJolt gained his nickname after he rewired the main control board of an arrogant, hateful, and disliked X-wing pilot to randomly give him irritating minor shocks every time he touched it after the first ten minutes of flight time, except when the S-foils were deployed for combat. Though nominally reprimanded by the base commander, the rest of the squadron and repair crews were highly entertained and appreciative of the lesson.\n\nJolt teaches the technique to many Rebel agents who pass through Tierfon Outpost, giving them another way to disrupt Imperial control panels on ships, vehicles, and equipment when straight-up destruction isn’t desired. In his little free time, he tinkers with other methods of clan destine technical damage and destruction.",

Indeed, both of Gareth’s parents are retired Galactic Republic Navy officers who served during the Clone Wars, and all of his siblings serve in the Imperial armed forces in one capacity or another. Drawn to spaceflight from an early age, Agamar entered the Imperial Naval Academy in the hopes of becoming a fighter pilot. Throughout his training, he exhibited a high level of professionalism, courage, and a strong grasp of fighter tactics. He graduated at the top of his class. After he served for years in various positions throughout the Imperial Navy, including a long stint as the aerospace group commander of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Mercurial, his skills in the cockpit and ability to wring every ounce of performance from a fighter brought him to the attention of the Imperial Navy’s prototype testing division. Responsible in part for the final testing of many of the Empire’s latest fightercraft, he is currently operating somewhere near Polis Massa, testing a top-secret fighter that promises to drastically change the course of the ongoing conflict with the Rebel Alliance.",

As a child, she watched helplessly as members of her family were dragged away in chains, one after another, by Imperial agents. This experience, combined with her strong will and natural fiery demeanor, drove her into the burgeoning resistance movement that was sweeping Mon Cala’s floating cities. Never much for military matters, Halari instead focused her efforts on organising protests, work stoppages, and general strikes. She did so with a combination of gravitas and rhetoric rarely found in one so young, and quickly gained a reputation as an inspiring and captivating speaker. And speak she did. Her fear of Imperial reprisals outweighed by her hatred of the interlopers and her rage at their treatment of her people, Halari spoke in the streets, in the council halls, and in the media, spreading a message of dissent and anger that immediately drew the ire of the Imperial authorities.\n\nAfter a failed kidnapping attempt and a successful campaign to discredit her and her allies, Halari went into hiding, constantly moving between safe houses and acting from the shadows rather than in Coral City’s parks and plazas. When the Empire was finally driven from Mon Cala, she came out of hiding and was immediately drafted to be one of the Quarren representatives to the Mon Calamari. Now, after only a few years in this position, she has made as many enemies as she has made allies. Her uncompromising attitude toward the Empire and toward the injustices suffered by the Quarren at the hands of the Mon Calamari, and her insistence in stating these attitudes loudly and repeatedly, makes her hard to negotiate with.",

This depraved Hutt had many enemies throughout the Outer Rim territories, and always kept a large detail of thugs and warriors around him. Yet, even that could not save him from his determined rivals. The slave master fell victim to a bomb placed in his ship’s docking bay while on Malastare to bet on the Podraces. The explosion wiped out Morbiss, his ship, his guards, and a large group of “cargo” the Hutt brought along to sell. It was only through sheer luck that the Nikto survived. The enforcer was dealing with a petulant slave who was giving his new master a hard time, which kept him at the edge of the docking bay when the bomb detonated.\n\nThe blast that set Kaa’to free also took his right leg and burned much of his right arm. Luckily, he had a hidden stash of credits on his person. When the medics arrived, the Nikto bargained with the Gran who found him to replace his leg. It exhausted all his credits, but Kaa’to Leeachos would live to finally throw off the shackles of the Hutts.\n\n With his credits wiped out, Kaa’to took to working as a hired guard on Malastare until he could buy passage on a transport offworld. As fate would have it, the only transport he could get took him to the world of Rodia, where his new career would begin. While on Rodia, Kaa’to found himself in the employ of the bounty hunter Knoke, a gruff Rodian who took a liking to the Nikto and taught him the ways of the hunt. Knoke was a successful hunter, but he met his end while on a contract to capture a rogue Jedi during the Great Purge. Kaa’to assumed the contract and finished the job. His reputation quickly grew after such a high-profile job. Within a few years he was in steady employ, with many clients. Knoke left his ship and equipment to Kaa’to, and with these at his disposal, the Nikto set out to earn a fortune for himself. \n\nUltimately, Kaa’to’s pride grew into hubris, and he began to look down on those who employed him, thinking himself nigh untouchable. Soon after staking out territory on Coruscant, the Nikto backstabbed the Pykes, bringing the Player Characters down on his trail.",

		"description": "Lieutenant Montra Varn, ISB, was there the day the last Imperial shut tle fled Coral City, carrying the remaining members of the Imperial Intelligence mission to the safety of the orbiting Star Destroyer and her evacuating squadron. She watched as the savage Mon Calamari and Quarren rabble cut down her friends and colleagues, screeching like brute beasts as they hacked her Imperial brethren apart with re-purposed industrial tools and stolen Imperial weapons. She saw the fires, the looting, the desecration of Imperial icons, and the mindless brutality with which prisoners were treated by the natives. She had never liked her posting to Mon Cala, or her necessary dealings with the “subcreatures” who called it home, but on that day, as she watched the shuttle’s boarding ramp close on an approaching mob, she swore that one day she would return. For nearly a standard year now, Special Agent Varn has been undercover on Mon Cala, posing as a technical contractor and using her skills as an intelligence operative to exact her revenge on the peoples of Mon Cala.\n\nHer mission is to sow discord and discontent, and to cause a conflict between the Mon Calamari and the Quarren severe enough to keep them fighting themselves and out of Alliance influence. To this end, she spreads rumors and plants false evidence of treachery and betrayal implicating high-ranking members of both species in one or another conspiracy to subjugate their counterparts and take complete control of post occupation Mon Cala. So far, her efforts have been wildly successful. The current talks being mediated by Alliance operatives are the last chance for peace.",

Thamoss has decided that Corte’s going to pay for her insults, and he intends to use his disruptor pistol to take his revenge.\n\nShould the PCs end up helping Thamoss, he is unlikely to offer them direct monetary compensation. He might, however, have some jobs for them in the future as enforcers. If the PCs make an enemy of Thamoss and he survives the encounter, though, they can expect to see the vindictive Trandoshan again in their future dealings in Hutt Space. The GM could represent this as a small Obligation generated by Thamoss’ ongoing animosity, or simply handle it narratively by having him appear again seeking recompense.",

After flitting about the galaxy with smugglers and earning a disdain for the Empire, Morbo joined the Rebel Alliance. Voralla’s unique background made her an ideal candidate to serve as an intelligence operative, and General Airen Cracken tapped her to serve as a spy and contact on Thyferra.\n\nVoralla invested in a cantina within the Zalxuc City business district. She called it M orbo’s Place, and it quickly gained a reputation as one of the finest establishments in the city. The tall, slender bartender with sultry looks and sandy blonde hair is a great conversationalist, and M orbo’s famous homemade brandy is great for loosening lips. Little do her high-class patrons know that when Voralla goes out to pick berries to make her brandy, she’s delivering regular reports back to Alliance Intelligence.",
