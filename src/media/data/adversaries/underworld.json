Arms dealers have access to large amounts of weaponry and are willing to sell them to anyone, for a price.

Regardless, these individuals are often in the market for smugglers or others who have ships of their own to transport goods to and from customers. Due to the sheer volume of firepower they have available to bring to bear if the situation requires it, it is an extremely bad idea to cross an arms dealer.",

Some of them find the notion of retire ment too boring to contemplate and instead decide to become something of a middleman, helping other smugglers connect with clients and individuals who need goods moved from one place to another without any troublesome questions. These men and women are sometimes called smuggler barons, a fitting title given the aristocratic airs some of them put on. Smuggler barons are not quite powerful enough to be considered crime lords in their own right, but can be powerful allies or inconvenient enemies.",

Among those who enter the life of a dancer, however, there are some who find that they enjoy it Those who do are typically able to make a good living entertaining the masses, although there are always those who find themselves in servitude to horrible masters like Jabba the Hutt, who is known to favor such dancers in his wretched court on the planet of Tatooine.",

Unfortunately for them, they are also fiercely independent and greatly value individuality and personal liberties. This is obviously a problem for the Empire and it is likely for that reason that the Imperial bureaucracy authorized the Wookiees as a slave race, making it legal for certain agencies to enslave them. The race’s home planet of Kashyyyk is something of a prison now and any Wookiee who attempts to leave the planet risks never being able to return. Because of their physical prowess as warriors, many enslaved Wookiees have found their way into the criminal underworld where they are pitted against other warriors in gladiatorial blood matches and various other illegal combat situations. Wookiees in this situation tend to have succumbed to despair and lost themselves in their anger and bitterness. They are terrifying opponents to face in combat, but if one can gain their trust, they also prove eter nal allies.",
