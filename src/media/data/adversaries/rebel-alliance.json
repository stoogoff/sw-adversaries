The troops who serve the Alliance believe that they are not just fighting for their own well-being, but that of their families and innocent people all across the galaxy.

With each atrocity or military intervention that the Empire commits, it becomes easier for the Alliance to point toward them when attempting to recruit new allies in their struggle. While some are afraid of the power of the Empire, validating such terror tactics, just as many individuals take great offense at the oppression and totalitarianism of their would-be masters and offer their support to the Alliance. High Command has a limited corps of diplomats, many formerly associated with the Galactic Senate, which is employed to make this sort of agreement happen. These diplomats are extremely patient, willing to wait as long as necessary for the innocent people of the galaxy to realize the truth; trying to press the point only increases their resistance. Waiting to secure what is necessary for victory as more atrocities are committed is a price that weighs quite heavily upon many of them",

The design team of Incom, the company that developed the X-wing, had long since defected to join the Alliance. Since that time, the individual team members and their hand-selected engineers-in-training have become the most elite technical consultants the Alliance has, offering innovative advancements to the organization in a number of different arenas, but most often in the area of starship enhancement.",
