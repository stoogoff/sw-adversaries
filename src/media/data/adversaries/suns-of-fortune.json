		"description": "One of Hollowtown’s billionaire elite, Benton Kaldo can trace his lineage to Corellian nobility. Kaldo’s wealth originated from ancestral successes in corporate investments, though his true nature is less benign. From his sprawling vineyard estate in Hollowtown, Baron Kaldo controls most criminal activity on Centerpoint Station. His organization primarily deals in spice and corporate espionage, but the occasional underground swoop or podracing event in active turbovator corridors nets Kaldo hefty gambling profits.\n\nA dark-haired and hawk-faced man in his early fifties, Baron Kaldo considers himself a blue-blood nobleman, and is always immaculately coiffed and clothed. Layers of servants insulate him from common citizens, whom he finds repellent. Despite this outward appearance of typical elitism, he is a shrewd manager of his organisation and unafraid to take risks. He often poses as a rival buy er or seller at Gustip’s more important dealings, where they use a sort of verbal code for Kaldo to covertly direct any decision-making right under the nose of others.",

They seem to be an evolutionary dead-end; they are primitive, flightless birds with reptilian features, a sharp black beak, beady eyers, and long powerful, legs that can kick holes in a ferrocrete wall. They are spiteful, cross-grained, and aggressive beasts that are hard to tame and dangerous to work with, even after they’ve been domesticated. As their name suggests, carrion spats feed on dead and decayed animals, which makes them unpleasant to be around due to the lingering stench of death that surrounds them. However, this diet makes them nearly immune to poisons and toxins, and some have even been reported to eat hazardous chemicals and industrial waste with no negative effects.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, they enjoy a fair amount of popularity as riding animals thanks to their size and endurance. Once tamed and used to both saddle and rider, carrions spats make excellent mounts, especially in rough or mountainous country where their innate sense of balance and wide-splayed feet allow them to move through broken terrain with ease. Eventually, after long periods of work with a rider, a carrion spat becomes bonded; after that, it will protect its rider at all costs, even to its death. In combat, unless otherwise directed, these creatures charge headlong into their enemies at incredible speeds, lashing out with their deadly feet and snapping at anything within range of their beaks. Once engaged, they are hard to extract and if they can’t be brought under control , they will fight until exhausted or killed.",

They stand about a meter high and are half again as long, with two flat, oval-shaped body segments, six multi-jointed walking legs tipped with wicked talons, and two crab-like pincers held well forward. The smaller, forward body segment contains their primitive ganglia, eyes, and mandibles, along with a number of long tentacles tipped with bioluminescent glands. The larger, longer rear segment contains the creature’s powerful heart and is tipped with a sharp and danger ous stinger. Strange and quite beautiful in their way, dalyrakes move with a purposeful, spidery grace.\n\nDespite their strange, occasionally frightening looks and their low intelligence, dalyrakes are easily domesticated and can be found in many homes and businesses throughout the Corellian System. While they are not affectionate, they are well-suited as pest control animals. Whether domesticated or wild, dalyrakes are slow and deliberate hunters. Typically, they submerge themselves in water or hide in bracken, underbrush, deadfalls, or piles of debris, then lure in prey with their waving tentacles. Once approached by a prey animal, a dalyrake pounces quickly and injects its target with the soporific venom produced by its stinger.",

They are completely blind and deaf, having neither eyes nor ears, and hunt by sensing heat and vibrations through the numerous clusters of receptor cells scattered throughout their bodies. In combat, they lash out with their flailing tentacles in an attempt to grab and entangle their prey. Once entangled, the prey is squeezed to death in the dimlurker’s powerful embrace and then swallowed whole.",

The flame ibbot’s diet consists of both small fish and insects native to the Boiling Sea, as well as the kettleweed that grows there. In fact, it is more from their habit of eating kettleweed, and not their colouration, that gives the flame ibbot its name. When threatened, flame ibbots spit a powerful jet of caustic bile and steaming hot water that builds up in their stomachs as they digest kettleweed.

Great ibbots have wicked, serrated orange beaks that can slice through nearly any material as if it were rotten cloth, and powerful talons that can tear a gundark limb from limb. They feed primarily on fish and other aquatic life-forms, and are particular to spikefish, snatching the massive creatures from lakes and seas when they surface for air. Although they prefer fish, wild specimens have a tendency to prey on herd animals (and even domesticated pets, on occasion).\n\nDue to their size and relative intelligence, great ibbots are easily domesticated. They take training quite well and can follow complicated multi-step instructions. The Wingriders, Drall’s state police force cum courier service, are mounted on these great beings and are the most visible keeper of great ibbots. There are also a number of tour companies who offer adventure tours of Drall’s countryside mounted on great ibbots, although these are rare due to the danger of mounting untrained individuals on willful, intelligent giant raptors.",

The Duros believed the Fefze would be able to handle the poisonous atmosphere and environmental damage of the mining areas; unfortunately, the toxicity levels were beyond even the Fefze, and they mutated. As the ecosystem completely collapsed and the Duros abandoned the planet, the fefze beetles were left behind to breed unchecked and scour all organic matter from the world.\n\nFefze beetles are as large as a two-person landspeeder. They are predatory by nature and attack any organic beings in their sensory range rapidly and voraciously. In addition, their digestive acids (powerful enough to break down anything remotely edible) can be spit at short ranges. The only saving grace for any group unlucky enough to encounter fefze beetles is that only a handful share a hunting area at a time.",

A ridge of sharp spines runs along a styanax’s dorsal ridge, and it possesses a powerful prehensile tail tipped with a wicked and venomous stinger.\n\nStyanax are, thankfully, largely solitary hunters. Territorial in the extreme, they only tolerate the presence of others of their kind during their short, violent mating season. Aggressive and forward, styanax are unsubtle in combat. They charge directly at their target, attempting to sting their prey with a soporific venom. Once incapacitated, a styanax grabs its prey in its powerful jaws and proceeds to shake it to death.",

Incredibly dim-witted, tunnel worms are instinct-driven creatures who live only to eat, grow and reproduce. Their diet consists of stones and a luminous fungus native to the Selonian tunnels. Their mynock-like mouths contain powerful olfactory sensors which differentiate between the faintest smells at great distances, and secrete a thick, powerful acid with the consistency of wet ferrocrete that sticks to everything. Given enough time, the sticky acid can reduce nearly any material to sludge.\n\nWhen left to their own devices, tunnel worms trundle through the Selonian den complexes eating fungus, debris, and filth. They keep the tunnels clean and occasionally burrow new tunnels or excavate long lost dens in their constant search for food. They are difficulty to provoke, but once angered, they spit their caustic saliva and lash about with their tails until the threat is melted or pummelled into submission.",

Corellian biologists are unsure from whence the wrix originates. They seem to have no natural ecological niche on Corellia, nor is there anything like them found in the planet’s fossil record.
