		"description": "Cybot Galctica, manufacturers of the renowned 3PO-series protocol droids, took a decidedly less human-centric approach to the design of the variant 3PX line marketed to customers in the Outer Rim. Because of the the diversity of species through the vast region, the droid was designed with a face based on no particular species, but with elements of several prominent groups through a wide swath of the Outer Rim territories.\n\nThe final result was recognisable to almost every species it encountered, but lacked the ability to connect with specific species as well as a more clearly defined 3PO model. Sales of the 3PX line suffered as a result, leading to a limited production run. However, resold droids tend to command the price of brand-new droids, thanks to the droid’s extensive cultural and linguistic databases. The Rebellion also favours use of 3PX-series droids, seeing them as a symbol that distances the Alliance from the Empire’s pro-human sentiment.",

They were produced by Cybot Galactica to compete with Serv-O-Droid Incorporated’s near monopoly on sales in the Mid Rim, but the project was not given adequate resources to break into such a diverse market. The 5YQ design team ended up recycling most of the work done on the earlier 3PO-series, but replaced the deep cultural databases previously used with a wide but shallow array of details on every conceivable topic. The final result was a droid that could operate in any part of the galaxy, but with considerably less effectiveness than a more specialised model. Given time, the 5YQ line might have been able to develop a market, but the production lines were shut because of a lawsuit against Cybot Galactica for using Serv-O-Droid parts in the 5YQ-series. This was the final black mark for the line, leaving them with a market share far lower than their relatively unremarkable performance would merit.",

Their personality matrix seems to have been programmed with the essence of every hard-nosed, uncompromising “strike first and ask questions later” law officer in history. They are loud, brash, and skilled at physical intimidation. Their grating manner and their tendency to use overwhelming force in inappropriate situations has led to numerous complaints against both the droids and Rim Securities. While civilians may despise the AC series droids, law enforcement agencies throughout the Outer Rim love them for their brutal efficiency, and they are slowly cornering the market for police droids at the edge of the galaxy.",

The droid’s sturdy construction is further reinforced with plasteel plates. and integrated so lar panels guarantee that it rarely needs recharging.\n\nThe droid’s programming emulates that of a very intelligent beast. and it communicates with its master in a series or yips. yelps. barks. and growls. GV/3 guardian droids come standard with strong loyalty imprint software that can be keyed to any number of subjects As long as a specific individual is imprinted in the droid’s memory, it follows that being’s commands and. to the best of its ability, prevents that person ’rom being injured. whether by deliberate action or by accident. Despite the GV/3’s physical strength, it is capable of being gentle and even playful. especially around children. The GV/3 is popularly used for home security and by law enforcement agencies. It has also been adapted to search and rescue operations with much success. Though it is considered a benign droid in most areas. some models have been modified by unscfUpulous individuals for criminal applications.",

Using a powerful cocktail of natural and artificial enzymes contained within their bodies, these droids turn garbage, food scraps, and other organic refuse into a nourishing nutrient sludge that can make up the large part of many a colonist’s daily caloric intake.\n\nStanding around two metres high, these had working droids consist of a broad, round body like a high-walled serving platter around 2.5 metres across covered by a retractable clamshell cover. Dexterous manipulator arms ring the droid’s body, and a dull red photoreceptor constantly scans its surroundings for trash. The droid’s body is perched on a single hard rubber wheel and is kept balanced by a sophisticated gyro-stabilisation system. More a remote than an actual sentient droid, these extremely dim-witted constructs are devoid of individual personality beyond a desire to hunt trash. They operate in packs, scouring their surroundings for organic refuse under the command of a central monitoring computer system.",

		"description": "Manufactured by Quarren Industrial on the planet Mon Cala, the Q-4 borer is a diminutive cylindrical mining droid .7 meters in length and .2 meters in diameter. Moving via a repulsorlift engine, the droids use drilling lasers to burrow through dirt and soft rock in search of veins of ore, which they can detect with the use of specialized sensors. Once the Q-4 discovers ore, it continues to search for additional veins, while larger mining droids are called in to extract the discovery.\n\nReferred to as “ mole droids” by the miners who use them, Q-4s possess a cheerful demeanor and pursue their work with apparent glee. Despite their carefree and can-do attitudes, Q-4s aren’t particularly bright, and they often bite off more than they can chew if left unattended for long periods of time. They are used in small teams and deployed in large formations to search for ore, and they operated easily both in atmosphere and underwater.",

		"type": "Rival",
		"description": "The R7-series is the latest member of Industrial Automaton’s highly respected R-series family of astromech droids. Designed specifically for use in the newly released E-wing multi-role starfighter, the R7-series was developed in secret, along with its bespoke starfighter, as part of a joint venture between IA and FreiTek Incorporated. Using the development of lA’s R6-series astromechs as cover, the R7 project set out to build the most competent and reliable astromech droid ever produced. Using an all-new, highly-advanced droid brain and the latest versions of lA’s tried-and-true astromech programming, the R7-series outshines even the venerable R2-series as an astrogator, technician, and starship pilot.\n\nThe R7 is an extremely novel design, using few parts or systems from earlier R-series droids. While it still has the iconic R-series barrel-shaped body, domed head, and two outboard legs with broad, treaded feet, that’s where the resemblance to its older cousins ends. The internal systems of the R7 are all new, and its power and computer systems are heavily shielded using circuit-hardening technology typically found in starfighters. The droid’s chassis is reinforced and constructed from stronger and lighter alloys than previous models. The triangle-shaped sensor eye is packed with advanced optical sensors that allow the droid to see in nearly any light as well as scan and analyze materials and structures for microfractures and stress fatigue. R7s are programmed with an eager, can-do personality that stands in stark contrast to the strange and surly personalities exhibited by their R5 predecessors.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all their advanced systems and genial personalities, the capabilities of the R7 series are limited. While they enjoy incredible synchronicity between their systems and the systems of the new E-wing starfighters for which they were designed, R7s find it difficult or even impossible to interface with older starfighters. Even the vaunted X-wing’s systems are too slow and clunky for an R7 to use fully. R7s can be programmed to interface with other starfighters, but their compatibility can never be one hundred percent. In game terms, this means that when connected with any starfighter or other vessel that isn’t an E-wing, an R7 loses the benefits of its Galaxy Mapper and Hold Together talents.",

The Verpine even attempted to market the droid to other insectoid species, still without much success.\n\nMost of the J9 worker drones purchased by the public were placed in labor jobs, wasting their more advanced systems and programming on menial tasks. Because of this, J9s are some of the most intelligent labor droids on the market. Over time, however, they develop somewhat bitter personalities, as they feel they were destined for something greater but were somehow cheated out of it.\n\nThe Rebel Alliance has acquired a large number of surplus J9 worker drones directly from Roche and has put them to good use. The Alliance realizes that the J9 is much more than a simple labor droid, and many of the units have been assigned to Rebel teams to assist them with translation and analysis. So far, the majority of these J9s have been a success in the field.",

The differences are not apparent to the casual observer, as the two droids are nearly identical visually. Instead, the improvements of the TC-series lie in two key areas of programming.\n\nFirst, TC units have benefited from increased design attention, giving them more stable and helpful personalities after some 3PO-series droids were reported to develop eccentric and grating personalities. Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, the TC-series is equipped with a more advanced version of the TranLang III communications module used throughout the protocol droid market.\n\nWhile almost any protocol droid is programmed with a vast array of languages and the capacity to decipher new ones with impressive speed, the TC-series excels above its competitors.
