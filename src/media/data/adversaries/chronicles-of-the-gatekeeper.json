In the earlier days of the Empire, he further cemented his reputation by tracking down and bringing in Jedi survivors and other Force sensitives. In more recent years, such bounties have become fewer and further between, and the bounty hunter is eager for the opportunity to test his mettle and earn a considerable commission from Duke Irbian.",

As the years went by and Warde did not return, Marcolf grew bitter, coming to believe that his friend had abandoned him for greater things, leaving him stranded on the remote planet. Rather than leaving Arbooine to look for Warde or find his own destiny, Marcolf cemented his position as reeve of the town, crafting a persona of a strong leader in the hopes that it would bring him a sense of self-worth. He found no happiness in power, and so he frequently vented his own anger and resentment through draconian proclamations and harsh punishments.",

To this day, she hates Warde, and it is this spite that drives her in all she does.
