In the earlier days of the Empire, he further cemented his reputation by tracking down and bringing in Jedi survivors and other Force sensitives. In more recent years, such bounties have become fewer and further between, and the bounty hunter is eager for the op­portunity to test his mettle and earn a considerable commission from Duke Irbian.",

As the years went by and Warde did not return, Marcolf grew bitter, coming to believe that his friend had abandoned him for greater things, leaving him stranded on the remote planet. Rather than leav­ing Arbooine to look for Warde or find his own destiny, Mar­colf cemented his position as reeve of the town, crafting a persona of a strong leader in the hopes that it would bring him a sense of self-worth. He found no happiness in power, and so he frequently vented his own anger and resentment through draconian proclamations and harsh punishments.",

An implanted res­pirator unit projects an intimidating synthesized voice and the wheeze of cybernetic lungs. Although usually hidden beneath opulent robes reminiscent of the greatest of Trade Federation leaders, the rest of Flasar’s body features similar mechanical replacements for the flesh and bone Warde took from her.\n\nAlthough she has built a thriving criminal empire, this is the not the life Flasar had planned. To this day, she hates Warde, and it is this spite that drives her in all she does. Flasar would savor the opportunity to vent that rage on any whom she perceives as allies of Warde, whether or not they have ever actually met the fallen Jedi.",
