These stasis cells were filled to the last with Rav Naaran’s thralls before the temple was abandoned. Many maddened souls remained there, frozen in timeless captivity, until the sabotaged systems released them. The worst off are capable of little more than obeying simple orders or inflicting violent harm, while a handful retain enough of their mind to assist their master in directing the rest.",

Even before he engaged in true battles in the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Naaran was a master of the lightsaber and a relentless foe to pirates, criminals, and anyone else who preyed on the citizens of the Republic. His skills in battle were honed by constant fighting, and his stubborn streak was tempered by the adoption of tactical discipline. The Jedi took to his wartime position like few others in the order, and his captivity has done little to dull his expertise. In fact, his time in stasis has kept him young and vigorous beyond his true age.\n\nNaaran has remained inside the temple, concealing himself from the gatekeepers using his Force powers. He hopes to scout out his surroundings with his thralls before making a move. His power over the dark side allows him to dominate beings who have been affected by its touch, from his old victims to the corrupted icewolves of the valley. In a grim echo of his days as a Republic general, he directs their efforts from the depths of the Dawn Temple, treating the shattered stasis chambers as a command center where he can view the big picture from within the minds of his broken servants. The gatekeepers may assume he leads from the front, but in truth, he is content to bide his time until he is sure of an advantage or need for action. The gatekeepers also err in assuming that his goal is escape: Rav Naaran intends to flee, yes, but first he intends to steal all three holocrons. To do so, he must lure the temple’s champions—the PCs—out into the valley to gain himself time to overcome the temple defenses",
