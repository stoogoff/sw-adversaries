They have short, brindled coats with white bellies; long, thick tails; and narrow, black legs that end in long, sharp claws. Their faces are remarkably expressive, with solid black eyes, large ears, and a broad mouth full of needle-sharp teeth.\n\nLoth-cats live solitary lives primarily in Lothal’s vast grasslands, coming together only to breed and raise kits. Hunting by sight and hearing, they prey largely on loth-rats and other assorted rodents and avifauna. Expert stalkers, loth-cats hunt their prey for hours or even days, waiting for the perfect time to attack. Once committed, a loth-cat springs from hiding and attempts to kill its prey as quickly as possible. When attacking prey larger than themselves, usually when frightened or cornered, a loth-cat typically goes for a target’s face first, clawing at eyes and any other sensitive areas. Loth-cats only fight larger prey until they can escape or the creature is driven off, and will run if they can.\n\nWhile most are wild, loth-cats can be domesticated, with varying degrees of success. They make fine, if capricious and slightly destructive, pets. With enough patience, they can even be trained to hunt and retrieve.",

These qualities, along with the fact that nerfs are completely unfazed by space travel, is what makes them so common throughout the galaxy.

When frightened, blismal make a shrill, painful, and sustained shrieking noise to ward off attackers and call for assistance from other blismal. When three or more blismal join in, they create a howl loud enough to shatter crystals and cause cave-ins, an ability that Jedi experienced firsthand long ago. The Jedi attributed this ability to the blismal’s close connection to the Force, and were able to counter the effects of the shrieking by manipulating the Force around the creatures. In doing so, Jedi exploring Ilum’s cavern system were able to capture blismal, which turned out to be relatively easy to domesticate.",

This ability allows them to tunnel through ice as though it were soft sand. Razhak usually build their nests inside of ice walls or densely packed snow, typically leaving the nest only to eat or mate.\n\nThankfully, while they are terrifying to behold and extremely dangerous, razhak are also easily distracted and creatures of minimal intelligence.

However, instead of simply diving and grabbing its prey, it uses the Force to pull its target into the air, where it catches it with its talons.

Although many wanderers leave behind friends and family, it is not in the nature of the gregarious Aleena to cut them selves off from family permanently. The wanderers usually circle back to home and hearth at least once every year or two to check on the health and happiness of their clan members, bless any newborn children, and enjoy a few days with a roof over their heads.\n\nIn addition to their travels, these groups of wanderers often maintain the colossal statues built by earlier generations. Usually, this is a simple matter of keeping a passage way clear of debris or driving off native fauna that seek to make their dens there. However, on occasion, as in the wake of one of the not-infrequent groundquakes that plague the planet, groups of Aleena must band together to effect larger repairs, usually drawing on the resources of nearby communities. In these cases, the Aleena communities showcase their knowledge of engineering and masonry, following the directions of the travelers in righting fallen statues and repairing damaged features. Sometimes these repairs are so extensive as to constitute practical replacements of entire statues. It was these rare instances that disproved earlier theories, held by offworld xenologists, that stated the Aleena could not have been responsible for building the monuments in the first place.",

These simple droids could remain still for millennia without maintenance, moving only when their sensors detected a threat. The powerful juggernauts would then attack all targets within their assigned area. Operating under the most basic of programming, most were unable to distinguish between friend and foe. The droids were heavily armoured and, in some cases, layers of cortosis lined the droid chassis beneath their heavy stone exteriors.
